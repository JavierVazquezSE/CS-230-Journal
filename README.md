## Draw It or Lose It

- The Gaming Room has hired CTS to convert their popular Android based game "Draw It or Lose It", into a web based gaming application, for a more broader audience and reach. CTS has assigned me to draft a Software Design Doc to explore and design the web application.

- In the document, I outlined potential benefits and drawbacks for different operating systems. I also closed off the document with my recommended choices for OS, languages, and security.

- Exploring different design patterns, such as the singleton pattern, allowed me to better develop code. 

- In order for me to write a better design document in the future, I would like to explore more about realm of security. Deeper understanding and knowledge of security would help me become a better developer and help keep my employer and its clients better secured. 

- I understood that The Gaming Room wanted to expand its reach in their attempt to create a web based application. I explored what options would be best for a web based game application while not disrupting what made their game such a success in the first place. I am confident that my recommendations will allow for the creation of a successful application.

- I approached the creation of the Software Design Doc by first trying to understand the goal of the client. While keeping that in mind I took into account what was already built. I explored the systems that would be best for what The Gaming Room wanted. In the future, I think this would be the best route. Staying client focused and delivering a quality application is best way to go in my opinion.
